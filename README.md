# DataStructures

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental data structures in Java. It is designed as a learning project to understand how different data structures work under the hood. Each data structure is implemented from scratch and includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

### 📦 Covered Data Structures:

- ✅ Arrays  
- ✅ Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)  
- ✅ ArrayLists  
- ✅ Stacks (using arrays and linked lists)  
- ✅ Queues (circular queue, priority queue, etc.)  
- ✅ Binary Search  
- ✅ Recursion-based examples  
- ✅ Other classic structures coming soon...

### 🎯 Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to help myself and others understand data structures through hands-on implementation and clear, beginner-friendly code.

### 🛠️ Language:
- Java (with simple, clean code and comments)

### 💡 Features:
- Educational and beginner-focused
- No external libraries or frameworks
- Step-by-step implementations
- Easy to follow and modify

### 🚀 Future Plans:
- Add Trees (Binary Tree, BST, AVL)
- Add Graph implementations
- Time & Space complexity analysis
- Unit tests and performance benchmarks

Feel free to use, modify, or learn from these implementations.  
Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
